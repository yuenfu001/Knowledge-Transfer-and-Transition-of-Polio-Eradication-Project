## Enhancing Polio Eradication Project Transition: Knowledge Transfer and Strengthening Implementation in Borno State Primary Health Care Development Agency

> #### Project Summary:
>>The project aimed to facilitate the smooth transition of a polio eradication project from the Solina Group to the Borno State Primary Health Care Development Agency. It focused on leveraging existing knowledge and resources within the agency to ensure continuity and efficiency in the implementation process. The project employed a Gantt chart to track implementation stages and deployed a knowledge assessment survey to bridge any knowledge gaps.
>
> #### Project Overview:
>>The project involved transferring the polio eradication project, which utilized the Reaching Every Children and Reaching Inaccessible Children initiatives, from the Solina Group to the Borno State Primary Health Care Development Agency. The transition aimed to minimize resource wastage by avoiding redundant training and instead filling the knowledge gap among agency workers.
>
> #### Highlights:
>
>> - Development of a comprehensive Gantt chart: A detailed Gantt chart was created to track different implementation stages, establish timelines, and monitor progress. This visual roadmap ensured transparency, coordination, and accountability throughout the project.
>>
>> - Knowledge assessment survey: A Google Form was deployed to assess the awareness and knowledge levels of healthcare agency workers regarding the implementation stages. This survey helped identify specific areas of weakness and guided the design of targeted training and support interventions.
>>
> #### Outcome:
>>
>> - Smooth project transition: The project successfully facilitated the transfer of the polio eradication project from the Solina Group to the healthcare agency. By leveraging existing knowledge and resources, the transition process was streamlined, ensuring continuity in project implementation.
>>
>> - Filled knowledge gaps: The knowledge assessment survey enabled the identification of specific knowledge gaps among agency workers. This information guided the development of tailored training and support interventions to bridge those gaps and enhance the agency's capabilities in implementing the project.
>>
>> - Efficient resource utilization: By avoiding extensive training from scratch, the project minimized resource wastage. Instead, it focused on filling specific knowledge gaps, optimizing the use of resources, and improving the overall efficiency of the project.
>>
>> - Strengthened implementation process: Through knowledge transfer and targeted interventions, the project aimed to enhance the implementation process of the polio eradication project. By empowering the healthcare agency with the necessary expertise, the project contributed to sustainable results and improved primary healthcare services in Borno State.
>>
>>> _Overall, the project successfully facilitated the knowledge transfer and transition of the polio eradication project, resulting in a strengthened implementation process and improved healthcare services in the targeted communities of Borno State._
